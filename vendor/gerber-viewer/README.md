## Overview

A cargo crate for rendering Gerber files.

The demo application also includes 'gerber playground' functionality by allows you to edit the gerber source and view
the changes!

## Demo

There is a minimal stand-alone demo app which renders the files in the `demo/assets` folder.

Run it:
```
cd demo
cargo run --release
```

See `demo/src/main.rs` and `demo/Cargo.toml` for details.

Red box = Axis aligned bounding box.
Green box = layer bounding box.
Blue cross-hair = Gerber 0,0 origin.
White cross-hair = Viewport center.
Orange line and point = Design offset.
Purple point = Design origin.
Single gerber layer rendered with individual shape coloring debug mode enabled.

## Rendering

Currently only egui is supported, but the code could be adapted for other rendering methods, PR's welcome.

Multi-layer rendering is supported, just create multiple `GerberRenderer` instances and call `paint_layer` for each one. 

## Status

Renders many gerbers files, but not all gerber commands and features are supported yet, see below.  The MakerPnP project
is currently the driving force for upcoming changes.

Current features are likely sufficient for viewing most modern PCB gerber files, the macro support is a key feature.

The list of supported features will be improved as developer time permits, if you'd like to contribute, please see the
[contributing](#Contributing) section below.

### Other rendering limitations

* All arcs are limited to 32 points for now.  This is fine for small arcs, but noticable on larger ones.

## Cargo Features

* `egui` Adds rendering support using egui.
* `parser` Adds the gerber parser as a re-export. This is helpful so you can depend just on this crate and ensures there
  are no version mismatches between the gerber types, gerber parser and gerber rendering.
* `types` Adds the gerber types as a re-export.  See above.

For the default features, see the [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml)

## Background

Uses `gerber-types` for specification of the gerber commands.

Gerber types can be programatically defined, or gerber files can be imported with the `gerber-parser`

This crate is used as core component of the [MakerPnP](https://github.com/MakerPnP/makerpnp) project, here's a screenshot from the MakerPnP gerber viewer showing multi-layer rendering:

## Feedback

If you have gerber files and have rendering issues, please create an issue with screenshots and a gerber file.  If
you're able to create a gerber file with just the elements that have issues that would be preferred.

## Contributing

Use the github issue tracker and pull-requests.  If you're embarking on a large change it's usually a good idea to
open an issue first to state your intention, for bug fixes and small changes just open a PR.
