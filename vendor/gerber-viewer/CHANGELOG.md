### v0.5.0 (2025-12-19)

- [changed] Change the `GerberViewer` API (Migration: use `new` instead of `default`, just move some of the arguments from `paint_layer` to `new`)
- [added] Added `gerber_to_screen_coordinates`. This allows you to draw on top or below the layer at the correct screen coordinates.
  The original use-case of this is to allow panel-unit numbers to be drawn on top of a panel outline gerber.
- [changed] Bump gerber-parser, gerber-types, egui and other dependencies.

### v0.4.4 (2025-07-25)

- [changed] Handle viewport relocation.
- [changed] Demo app now shows one window for each file.
- [changed] Bump gerber-parser.
- [added] Added feature that allows the user to edit the source for each demo and see the changes.

### v0.4.3 (2025-07-21)

- [fixed] Fix missing scale from circles.
- [fixed] Fix incorrect scaling on axis-aligned rectangles when an offset was used. 

### v0.4.2 (2025-07-21)

- [fixed] Fix not applying transform to axis-aligned rectangles. 

### v0.4.1 (2025-07-17)

- [changed] Add support for unclosed regions, as found in some EasyEDA generated files. SPEC-ISSUE: closed-vs-unclosed-regions
- [changed] Using rust 2024 edition.

### v0.4.0 (2025-07-14)

### v0.2.0 (2025-07-10)

- [added] Support for legacy/deprecated gerber commands: MI, SF, OF, IR, and AS.
  This is a breaking change because you must use the `GerberLayer::image_transform` method.
  Refer to the commit that updated `demo/src/main.rs` and make the corresponding changes to your app.
- [changed] bumped gerber-types and gerber-parser dependencies, the former added new types which may result
  in compilation errors due to additional enum variants.
